# K-Means Clustering Practice

This repository contains code for practicing k-means clustering on a dataset of country data. The purpose of this project is to explore k-means clustering, visualize the clustering results, choose the optimal number of clusters, and interpret the findings.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/k-means-clustering.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine along with the required dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.

3. Place the `Country-data.csv` file containing the country data in the root directory of the repository.

4. Execute the Python script `k_means_clustering.py`.

## Code Overview

The main script `k_means_clustering.py` performs the following tasks:

1. Importing necessary libraries for data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization.
2. Importing and cleaning the country data from the `Country-data.csv` file.
3. Scaling the data using StandardScaler from scikit-learn.
4. Fitting a k-means model with a specified number of clusters.
5. Visualizing the clustering results using scatter plots.
6. Determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
7. Choosing the number of clusters based on critical thinking and domain knowledge.
8. Generating descriptive statistics for each cluster.
9. Plotting box plots for selected variables across clusters.
10. Analyzing and interpreting the clustering results.

## Results and Interpretation

After running the script, you will obtain visualizations of the country data clustered into different groups based on selected features such as GDP, income, and child mortality rate. Additionally, you will find descriptive statistics for each cluster and insights into the socioeconomic characteristics of countries within each cluster.

## Observations and Conclusions

Based on the clustering results and descriptive statistics, it is observed that...
